These course materials are for a lecture series I taught at the Madison Institute for Mathematical Finance over the summer of 2025. 
It is based on an independent study I did with Dr. Beth Arnold (not for credit) & Dr. Ravi Shankar (for credit) at James Madison University.
Lectures are available via recording, just email me for access @ tartertx@dukes.jmu.edu.
